## Data Notes
This metadata was collected and is maintained in a Lotus Notes database. The Data Librarian has exported this data, and applied some data clean-up, such as applying consistant formats to dates, organizations, and location names. However, some of the information is ambigious and would not be ideal for all applications. It is advisable to fork this repository and filter the data based on the quality that you need. As our metadata is refined through further research, I will add it to this repository.
