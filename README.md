# Historic-WHOI-Cruise-Metadata
Historic cruise metadata from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) ships from 1931 to 1998, encompassing cruises from Atlantis, Anton Dohrn, Caryn, Albatross III, Bear, Yamacraw, Chain, Crawford, Aries, Gosnold, Atlantis II, Asterias, Lulu, Albatross IV, Knorr, Oceanus, and Atlantis (AGOR-25) ships. More information about the cruises and ships referenced is available from the WHOI Data Library. 

This metadata was collected and maintained in a Lotus Notes database. The Data Librarian has applied some data clean-up, such as applying consistant date formats and location names.
